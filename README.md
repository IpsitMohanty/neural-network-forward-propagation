# Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network that demonstrates the process of forward propagation. The code allows you to create a neural network with multiple layers and nodes, propagate inputs through the network, and compute predictions.

## Features
- **Customizable Network Structure**: You can define the number of inputs, hidden layers, nodes in each layer, and the output layer.
- **Forward Propagation**: Computes the weighted sum and activation at each node and propagates the data through the network.
- **Sigmoid Activation Function**: Uses the sigmoid function for non-linear transformation of the weighted sum at each node.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
